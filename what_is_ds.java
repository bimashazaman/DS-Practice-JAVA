//ds is a named location that can be used to store data. 

//e.g. a stack, queue, hash table, etc. why is this important?  what is the difference between a stack and a queue?  what is the difference between a hash table and a linked list?  what is the difference between a hash table and a binary search tree?   


//what is array?  array is a collection of elements stored at the contiguous memory locations. like char[] array; 


//what is algorithm?  algorithm is a set of rules that can be applied to a set of data. e.g. sorting, searching, etc.

//what is stack?  stack is a data structure that can be used to store data in a LIFO (last in first out) manner. push() and pop() are used to add and remove data from the stack. Lifo is last in first out. it is like a vertical tower

                // |________4______|  -> TO ADD 4 TO THE STACK USE push(4) 
                // |________4______|                    -> To remove 4 from the stack use pop()
                // |________3______|  -> TO ADD 3 TO THE STACK USE push(3)
                // |_______4_______|   
                // |_____4_________|
                // |________8______|
                // |________8______|
                // |_______4_______|
                //
                //          ||
                //          ||
                //          ||  
                //          \/
                //peek returns
                 the top element of the stack.
                //pop returns the top element of the stack and removes it from the stack.
                //push adds an element to the top of the stack.
                //isEmpty returns true if the stack is empty.
                //size returns the number of elements in the stack.


//what is queue?  queue is a data structure that can be used to store data in a FIFO (first in first out) manner. enqueue() and dequeue() are used to add and remove data from the queue. FIFO is first in first out. it is like a horizontal tower
